# Missing Error Handling in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input.  The example shows a route that retrieves user data based on a provided ID.  However, it lacks crucial error handling, leading to potential issues if an invalid ID is passed.

## The Bug

The `bug.js` file contains the flawed code. The route handler attempts to access and display the requested user data, but without validation or error handling for cases where the user ID is invalid or non-existent. This can result in unexpected behavior or crashes.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that includes comprehensive error handling. It checks the validity of the user ID, returns a 404 error if the ID is invalid or the user is not found, and handles other potential errors gracefully.
